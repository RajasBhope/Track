# Self-Driving Car Behavior Cloning

# Introduction
This project focuses on utilizing behavior cloning to enable self-driving cars to mimic human driving behavior. The approach involves collecting driving data using Udacity's self-driving car simulator and training a neural network model to replicate the observed driving behavior. Specifically, the NVIDIA model architecture is employed for behavior cloning, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn driving patterns from input images.

# Dataset Used
The dataset utilized for training the behavior cloning model consists of driving log files and corresponding images captured by the car simulator. The driving log files contain information about steering angles, throttle, and other relevant parameters, while the images provide visual input for the neural network model.

# Methodology Used
Data Collection: Driving data is collected using Udacity's self-driving car simulator, which generates images and corresponding driving log files capturing human driving behavior.
Data Preprocessing: The driving log files are parsed to extract image file paths and steering angles, which serve as input-output pairs for training the neural network. Images are preprocessed to enhance features and reduce noise, including resizing, cropping, and normalization.
Data Augmentation: To improve model generalization, data augmentation techniques such as random flips, translations, and brightness adjustments are applied to increase the diversity of training samples.
Model Architecture: The NVIDIA model architecture, a deep CNN consisting of convolutional layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers, is employed for behavior cloning. This architecture is well-suited for end-to-end learning from visual input.
Training: The model is trained using the preprocessed training dataset, optimizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss function through backpropagation. Training is conducted in mini-batches to efficiently update model weights.
Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess its ability to accurately predict steering angles and replicate driving behavior.
